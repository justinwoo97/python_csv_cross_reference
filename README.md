## What am I trying to solve? 
Find out donors/benefactors we should invite back for next year based on their activeness. 

## About Each CSV File
- [x] Each CSV file contains 600-700 rows of data
- [x] There are total 38 CSV files
- [x] Total Data (600-700) X 38 = (**22800 - 26600**) rows
- [x] You can view the exmaple CSV file [here](./example_file.csv)

## The goal for this project is to
 - [x] Extract all the non-duplicate names from 38 CSV files 
 - [x] Cross-reference all the names with all the CSV files 
 - [x] Export the results into [final_csv_file.csv](./final_csv_file.csv)
